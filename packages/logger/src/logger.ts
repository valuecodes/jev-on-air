 * Builds the pino instance whose wire format is what Cloud Logging expects.
 * Every setting here exists because the default is wrong for Cloud Run, so none
 * of them is safe to drop:
 *
 * - `messageKey: "message"` — Cloud Logging promotes `message` to the Logs
 *   Explorer summary line and leaves pino's default `msg` inert in the payload.
 * - `timestamp: isoTime` — writes `"time": "<RFC3339>"`, one of the three time
 *   forms Google recognises, which is then moved to `LogEntry.timestamp` and
 *   stripped from the payload. pino's default epoch integer matches none of
 *   them, so entries would silently carry their *collection* time instead.
 * - `base: null` unless bindings are given — on Cloud Run `pid` is always 1 and
 *   `hostname` is a throwaway sandbox id already exposed as `labels.instanceId`.
 * - `formatters.level` — see severity.ts.
 * - `formatters.log` — see error-reporting.ts.
 *
 * Everything, including ERROR, goes to **stdout**. Cloud Run tags anything on
 * stderr as ERROR automatically, which would fight the explicit severity above.
 *
 * `sync: true` is not pino's default, and the default is the wrong choice here:
 * async writes rely on an exit-time flush, but a serverless runtime throttles
 * CPU to near zero once a response is sent — exactly when a background task
 * writes the ERROR explaining a failure — and an app may call `process.exit()`
 * on SIGTERM. Writing synchronously means there is never anything to flush.
