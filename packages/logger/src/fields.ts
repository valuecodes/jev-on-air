 * pino looks up its per-key serialiser and stringifier with plain bracket
 * access on ordinary objects (`serializers[key]`, `stringifiers[key]`), so a
 * top-level field named after an `Object.prototype` member resolves to an
 * inherited function instead of `undefined`. The results are not subtle:
 * `hasOwnProperty` throws `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to
 * object` out of the log call, and `toString` emits
 * `"toString":[object Undefined]` — an unparseable line, which Cloud Logging
 * drops.
 *
 * That turns `logger.info("request", req.query)` into a remote crash or a way
 * to make specific lines disappear, so these keys are removed before anything
 * reaches pino. Only top-level keys are affected; nested objects go through
 * `JSON.stringify` and are already safe.

 * Keys Cloud Logging reads by name. Bindings are written ahead of call-site
 * fields and nothing de-duplicates them, so a call-site field of the same name
 * is emitted second — and every JSON parser keeps the last value. That lets a
 * caller-supplied object silently rewrite the line's own metadata: a
 * `{"severity":"DEBUG"}` field on a `logger.error(...)` call files the entry as
 * DEBUG, where no `severity >= ERROR` alert will ever see it, and a forged
 * `time` or trace id backdates the entry or attaches it to someone else's
 * request.
 *
 * Bindings may still set these — `child(parseTraceHeaders(...))` is the
 * supported way to attach trace fields, and the app owns its own bindings.
 * Only call-site fields are restricted.
