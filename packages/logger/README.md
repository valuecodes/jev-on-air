# @repo/logger

A [pino](https://getpino.io) logger that emits single-line JSON shaped for **Google Cloud Logging**.

```ts
import { Logger } from "@repo/logger";

const logger = new Logger({ bindings: { service: "api" } });

logger.info("server ready", { port: 8080 });
logger.error("request failed", { err, requestId: "abc" });

const requestLog = logger.child({ requestId: "abc" });
requestLog.info("fetched"); // carries requestId
```

**Message first, fields second — in every method.** That is the opposite of pino's own
`(obj, msg)`, and it is deliberate: `Logger` wraps pino rather than re-exporting it, so pino's
`(message, ...args)` printf overload is unreachable. A call cannot land on it by accident and
interpolate the fields _into_ the message string, which is the one silent way to lose a line's
contents. The wrapper owns the shape, so there is only one shape.

This is a Node package: pino writes to file descriptor 1. It is not for browser bundles.

## Two constraints, both easy to break

**1. Keep it bundler-safe.** Services are typically bundled into a single file and shipped without
`node_modules`. So:

> Never use a pino `transport:`, `pino-pretty`, `pino.multistream`, or anything else backed by a
> worker thread — not even behind a `NODE_ENV !== "production"` branch.

pino resolves transport worker entry points by path at runtime, so they are not in the module graph
and will not be in the bundle. Plain `pino()` with a `destination` bundles cleanly.

**2. The field names are a contract with Google's parser, not a style choice.** Every one of these
fails _silently_ if renamed — a wrong key is not an error, just a field nobody looks at:

| Field                                  | What Cloud Logging does with it                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `severity`                             | Promoted to `LogEntry.severity`. Drives Logs Explorer colouring and every `severity >= ERROR` filter or alert. Replaces pino's numeric `level`.                                                                                                      |
| `message`                              | Promoted to the Logs Explorer summary line. pino's default `msg` is **not**.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `time`                                 | An RFC3339 **string**, one of the three time forms Google recognises. Moved to `LogEntry.timestamp` and stripped from the payload, so entries carry their emit time rather than their collection time. pino's default epoch integer matches nothing. |
| `stack_trace`                          | Parsed by **Cloud Error Reporting**, which groups the error event on these frames.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `logging.googleapis.com/trace`         | Promoted to `LogEntry.trace`; nests a request's lines under the request entry.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `logging.googleapis.com/spanId`        | 16-char **hex**. Note `X-Cloud-Trace-Context` sends the span as a _decimal_ uint64 — `trace.ts` converts it.                                                                                                                                         |
| `logging.googleapis.com/trace_sampled` | Promoted to `LogEntry.traceSampled`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

`pid` and `hostname` are dropped: on Cloud Run `pid` is always 1 and `hostname` is a throwaway
sandbox id already exposed as `labels.instanceId`.

Everything, including `error`, goes to **stdout**. Cloud Run tags anything on stderr as ERROR
automatically, which would fight the explicit `severity`.

## Levels

`debug` · `info` · `warn` · `error` · `silent`. pino's `trace` and `fatal` are not part of the
vocabulary, though `severity.ts` still maps them because pino renders a severity for every level it
knows about.

`LOG_LEVEL` overrides the default, which is `info` under `NODE_ENV=production`, `silent` under
`NODE_ENV=test`, and `debug` otherwise. An unrecognised `LOG_LEVEL` falls back and logs one
`WARNING` naming the value rather than crashing — a bad level announces itself in the very next
line.

## Errors

Pass the `Error` itself as the `err` field. It reaches pino's error serialiser, which folds any
`cause` chain into the message and stack, and `formatters.log` promotes the frames to a top-level
`stack_trace`:

```ts
logger.error("request failed", { err: error, requestId: "abc" });
```

`@type` and `serviceContext` are deliberately not set. Setting `@type` would promote _every_ ERROR
line into Error Reporting, including ones that describe a policy outcome rather than an exception.
The rule this encodes is narrower and more useful: **a line carrying a real `Error` becomes an error
event, and nothing else does.**

## Trace correlation

Trace fields are ordinary `child()` bindings. Parse the incoming headers once per request, build one
traced child, and pass it down — there is no ambient context:

```ts
import { parseTraceHeaders } from "@repo/logger";

const trace = parseTraceHeaders({
  traceparent: req.header("traceparent"),
  cloudTraceContext: req.header("X-Cloud-Trace-Context"),
});
const requestLog = trace === undefined ? logger : logger.child(trace);
```

The consequence to know: **only loggers descended from that child are traced.** Code that imports a
module-level logger directly and logs during a request produces an untraced line, and nothing in the
type system will tell you. Pass the logger down.

W3C `traceparent` wins over `X-Cloud-Trace-Context` when both are present.

By default the bare `TRACE_ID` is emitted, because it needs no project id. But Google documents the
value of `logging.googleapis.com/trace` as the **qualified** resource name
`projects/<PROJECT_ID>/traces/<TRACE_ID>`, and that is the form that reliably links an entry to
Cloud Trace — so pass a project id when you have one:

```ts
parseTraceHeaders(headers, { projectId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT });
```

If trace correlation does not appear in the Logs Explorer, this is the first thing to set.

Because a child is an ordinary value captured lexically, **work that outlives its request keeps the
trace it started under**, and it does not depend on async-context propagation surviving an abandoned
promise.

## Testing

`@repo/logger/testing` captures the **serialised** line and parses it back, so assertions are about
what Cloud Logging will actually receive:

```ts
import { createTestLogger } from "@repo/logger/testing";

const { logger, lines } = createTestLogger();
logger.info("heartbeat", { taskId: "a" });
expect(lines[0]).toMatchObject({ severity: "INFO", message: "heartbeat" });
```

To fake a logger rather than capture from one, depend on the `LoggerLike` type: it names no private
state, so a plain object literal satisfies it. The concrete `Logger` class does not, by design.

## Not configured, on purpose

**No `redact` — know what that costs you.** pino's default `err` serialiser copies _every own
enumerable property_ of an `Error` onto the emitted `err` object. That is a real leak on the one
path this README tells you to use: an `axios`/fetch-wrapper rejection carries `err.config.headers`,
so `logger.error("http call failed", { err })` writes the outbound `Authorization` header and
request body into Cloud Logging, readable by anyone with `roles/logging.viewer`.

There is no _default_ `redact` because the right path list is app-specific and matchers are compiled
at construction and walked per line. Pass one via `LoggerOptions` in any service that handles
credentials:

```ts
const logger = new Logger({
  bindings: { service: "api" },
  redact: ["*.authorization", "*.token", "err.config.headers.authorization"],
});
```

Until you do, the rule is narrower than "don't log raw headers": **don't pass an `Error` you did not
construct without knowing what it carries.**

**No duplicate-key guard, except where it matters.** Bindings are written ahead of call-site fields
and nothing de-duplicates them, so a repeated key is emitted twice and JSON parsers take the last
value: the call site wins and the binding is lost. Don't shadow bound keys.

The exception is the set Cloud Logging promotes out of the payload — `severity`, `message`,
`httpRequest`, `stack_trace`, every timestamp form (`time`, `timestamp`, `timestampSeconds`,
`timestampNanos`) and the `logging.googleapis.com/*` keys (`insertId`, `labels`, `operation`,
`sourceLocation`, `trace`, `spanId`, `trace_sampled`). Those are **stripped from call-site fields**
(`fields.ts`), because otherwise an object spread from untrusted input could file an ERROR as
`severity: "DEBUG"` where no alert would see it, backdate `time` out of an incident window, forge an
`insertId` so a later genuine entry is deduplicated away, or attach the line to another request's
trace. `child()` bindings may still set them — that is how `parseTraceHeaders` works.

Field names colliding with `Object.prototype` (`hasOwnProperty`, `toString`, `constructor`, …) are
dropped for a different reason: pino resolves its per-key handlers with bracket access, so those
keys would throw out of the log call or emit an unparseable line.
